# GetheodeEngine

A C# library that provides tools for constructing fictional languages. The end goal is an engine that automates the process of conlanging using generative grammar. It will aim to immitate the patterns of real languages as well as possible.

This is an early version of a project I have just begun developing.

Geþeode `/jeˈθe͜oː.de/` is Old English for "language"

!!! note
    The rules of the grammar operate in a mechanical fashion; one may think of them as instructions that 
    might be given to a mindless robot, incapable of exercising any judgment or imagination in their 
    application. Any ambiguity or inexplicitness in the statement of rules must in principle be 
    eliminated, since the receiver of the instructions is assumed to be incapable of using intelligence to 
    fill in gaps or to correct errors."
    – Chomsky & Halle (1968: 60)
