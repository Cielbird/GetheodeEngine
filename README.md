# GetheodeEngine

A C# library that provides tools for constructing fictional languages. The end goal is an engine that automates the process of conlanging using generative grammar. It will aim to immitate the patterns of real languages as well as possible.

This is an early version of a project I have just begun developing.

Geþeode `/jeˈθe͜oː.de/` is Old English for "language"
